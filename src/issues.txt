Issues to be resolved + investigated: 

1. Frisbee data hangs on the part where i am initializing weak PDE library for training


TODO
1. Figure out why code cannot continue for frisbee but works for other types of data 



After implementing features:
- test on real data, start to quantify accuracy 

Things to do: 
- Look at other research or code that predict trajectory as a comparison 
- look/create simple csv file where object change direction (can use the takeoff_circle file as that has one obvious change in direction)
