Issues to be resolved + investigated: 

1. rmse index is always 0, due to the fact that the coefficients seem to always be the same across all the thresholds
Idea: Is this caused by the fact that because I use ensemble, the last model is saved instead of the median? 
so currently i am able to get it to choose not just the index 0, but have seen index 1 and 2 
so maybe it is not an issue for now. 
lsoda--  warning..internal t (=r1) and h (=r2) are
       such that in the machine, t + h = t on the next step 
I get this warning when the hyperparameter is too low, so how do i generalize my code to choose this hyperparameter? 

2. How do I use the median ensemble coefficients instead of the last fitted model? My calculations seem to be getting worse if I use this compared to before
# TODO: how do i use the ensemble coefficients instead of the last model coefficients and pass it to my predict model 

Features that I need to implement: 
- Modularize code further so this can run on different type of data inputs (now it is very adapted to just projectile)
- Take in window of data and predict only 1 or less second of future trajectory 
- Continuous prediction every 0.5 seconds using a while loop 

After implementing features:
- test on real data, start to quantify accuracy
